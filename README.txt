MONITISE README



-INSTRUCTIONS:

	-In Firefox v19+, open two or more tabs with index.html.  After entering a username for each, the chat should behave exactly to spec as if an actual server were in play.  Event driven chat with new messages appearing below those that appeared before it and scrolling out of view at the top of the chat window.
	
	-As requested the chat window uses, and requires, an HTML5 browser.  However, due to Chrome's use of a separate engine per tab, simulating the multi-way chat behavior isn't possible.
	
	
	
-CLARIFICATIONS:

	-I briefly questioned whether I should utilize JQuery or not here as it is sometimes asssumed that familiarity with JQuery equates unfamiliarity with standard Javascript.  I would like to stress here that I CAN AND DO code in standard Javascript often.  I thought it better, in this case, to demonstrate knowledge of more, rather than less, tools.
